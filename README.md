# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python
## A collection of different excercises from the textbook, "Data Structures & Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser.

While attending Cerritos College, I took a DSA class with an emphasize in the Java language. I had not taken a Java course prior so therefore, much of the material that I had learned was convoluted. In addition to current course work, I will be once again grasping the fundamentals in a self-guided manner. My goal with this repository is to:

* Relearn DSA in a more familiar language.
* Get ready for coding interviews.
* Finally have fun with DSA :D

Feel more than welcome to critque my solutions and even add your own! :D
